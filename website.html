Interest in IT
<ul>
<li>
My brother is the one who inspired me to follow the IT patch. I said that because anytime I saw him on the computer, his fingers  surfed on the keyboard so fast that I couldn't even recognize what he was trying to type. Each line of code he types on the computer makes me wonder what he is going to create with those lines. Suddenly, he shows me that if any spam email or malware wants to enter our PC system, it will immediately remove the harmful material. From that moment, I feel that IT will be my future career where I could develop software that protects others' private information against those hackers who try to steal bank accounts, and customer data. Moreover, I have participated in a robotics coding competition 2 years ago which my team earned second place overall. This powerful experience I gained was really helpful with the major I currently study in Rmit. I have taken one more step closer to become a skillful software developer. Although I still need to put more effort into it, I will try my best.

</li>
&ensp;
<li>
I choose to study at Rmit because this university provides students with the most advanced technology for IT learning. In addition, many skillful, talented software engineers graduated from this University, and they all get hired by famous companies such as Google, Microsoft. Therefore, I want to become a member of Rmit where I could prove to everyone what my talent is, and maybe earn some computing reward. At Rmit, I can have the best study environment as well as the kind,helpful teachers. There is nothing to say much about the school facilities because everything is perfect. I like the way teachers in Rmit taught students, if you don’t understand one part of the lecture, the teacher always please reply to your email about parts that you have trouble with.
</li>
&ensp;
<li>
I expect to learn new coding language, as well as knowing some new friends which can be helpful if I got stuck at some point. Moreover, I would want to build a coding base which I can launch from that to become a successful software programmer.

</p>
<ul>
	<li>The position that I choose is IT engineering. The company required a leader for the IT engineering team, and the leader must support others in order for them to develop their skills. From my point of view, this position attracts me because I always want to become a leader of a team, or groups. Moreover, influencing other people, and helping them in work that they struggle with are my two strongest characteristics.
</li>
	<li>This position requires us to have experience in programming robots to transfer the semiconductors. Moreover, you must know how to code in C, and C++ coding language. Knowing the Japanese language is an advantage but not a requirement. In addition, you should have experience in this field, and graduate university. IOT and PLC need to be equipped in order to fit to this position.
</li>
	<li>Currently I study python and soon after this course I can learn more about other coding styles. I have watched lots of youtube people that teach coding, and I have tried to code some difficult commands. I have a nomination of winning a robot coding competition so I could use that as my experience in this field.
</li>
	<li>Right now, I will focus more on the lecture the teacher is giving to us in class, beside that I would look for a higher coding line on the internet to test myself. I have bought lots of books about robots, and developed a software to operate it successfully. I know lots about software so I'm definitely going to improve my current skills, and try to practice them every single day. One other method that I could try is I could ask my bigger brother, he is the master of this field, as I mentioned before. My brother always pleased to teach me the technique from basic up to complicated stuff, as far as I can still understand.With the help of family members, I think I should know more deeply about my major, and it is really useful when I apply my CV into the company for the leader position.</li>

<ul>
<li>
From those tests, the result does mean a lot because it shows my strengths, and weaknesses. Moreover, I can figure out the way to adapt with my teammates if I need to work by team. Through these tests, I learn a lot about myself such as my personality, life skills, and areas where I need to improve. Therefore, I was able to understand my study type, as well as how I could be affordable in working on team projects.
</li>
<li>
	Personally I think that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, therefore the test demonstrates a clear view of our personality in a team. The results will help me to find teammates easier because I know what kind of person would be suitable, and comfortable with my personality. Beside that, I should try to improve my weaknesses such as communication, stress during the deadline pressure, to be able to deal with team problems. In addition, I can make my teammates easier to understand or listen to my ideas as I reduce the characteristics that others dislike. Resulting in work efficiently, and the productivity will be high.
</li>
<li>
	When forming a team, I often look for people with these personalitíes such as hard work, friendly, creative, and helpful. Àfter finishing the three tests online, I can look for people that have some good strength, and their strength can replace my weakness. Furthermore, it is vital for me to have a team that most of them can put all of their effort into a project. Quality is always better than quantity.

	<p>Project Ideas</p>
	<p>

 In this modern world, technology has played an important role in our daily life. For instance, people cannot go out without their phones because what if someone has a really vital situation, and they want to call you. The example that has been given shows that we could not communicate easily if there is not the existence of technology. Moreover, I have a dream of creating a personal AI, and it can communicate with humans perfectly. The personal assistance that can access our technology devices, and that AI can do anything if we command them by our voice, just like the Siri of iphone but more intelligent.
 &ensp;
 &ensp;
 I had this idea while I was watching Iron Man. In that movie there was an AI named “Jarvis” which can do everything from searching information online, receiving phone calls, and controlling any devices that link to the AI. Furthermore, I want the AI to be a VIP replacement of an alarm clock, or carlender. The wonderful Jarvis in the movie can access online and search for information that the owner needed, as well as saving phone numbers. These ideas probably will be valuable in this society where people are too busy to work, and they may forget to perform some task, the AI is the way to solve the issues.
&ensp;
&ensp;
 I would like to named that AI “R”, it stands for “reminder”. This AI I wanted to create for those who have memorize problem, and the one that have problems with their study schedule. The interesting things about the AI that will program in any phone brands are the voice recognition, you must be the owner of the phone to be able to access it, and all your information will be secure if you accidentally lose your phone. Moreover, each person can register for one “reminder” and your robot friend can access all of your technology devices which could help you manage the data, even anti-virus. Our specialized AI is well prepared and consists of the latest anti-virus software, firewall, which prevents hackers from entering and stealing the privacy information.  Beside that, anyone that have problem with short term memory, our AI can solve that problem by studying and watching the person routine, or else you can input things you want to memorize into the AI, it will automatically stored. For instance, your mom birthday is coming and you forget about it, when that day come, the AI will tell you what you have reminder on this day. In addition, no one can refuse the convenient of this type of program, as well as the behave of the AI, it could be one of your friend because it can communicate, and feel your emotion. One of the features that make it stands out is that it can develop thought through learning it owner behavior. I decided to make this AI to be use globally, and anyone can obtain their individual AI. You can named your robot with any name that you want. Furthermore, we will create a contract that guarantee free maintenance if needed, as well as upgrade the “R”.        	 “R” can perform multiple tasks at the same time as the same as you can open multiple tabs on google chrome. Therefore, this AI can help you find information online as you provide the key words and it can open some soft music for you to concentrate on completing the task. The product of our team will help others to reduce their stress about remembering too many things at one time. Moreover, some dangerous diseases such as stroke, headache. We guarantee that if there are any problems with the “R”, we fully repair it without charging any extra fees. We also provide insurance for the program which you probably don’t lose any money if something goes wrong with the system. Not to mention, our AI design for operating the house too. This means we will set up the AI into your house in order to command the program by voice for example open the door by voice, or open the air conditioner. Instead of moving around and getting to the destination to do something, everything suddenly becomes automatic, all you need is to say a command.
&ensp;
&ensp;
 I think prowriting aid is one of the artificial software that is used to write AI programs. I have not learned it yet but I will try to in order to complete my dream. I think I should need a team that has skills that are required to write an AI program, and also creative teammates. Therefore, I should push myself through the limit in which I could upgrade my program skills to meet the expectation to become a professional AI developer. I also want to support people that have difficulty with memorizing things so they can feel comfortable because they're always a reminder.
 &ensp;
 &ensp;
In this project, it required teamwork skill, communication skill to be able to get funding money by the investor. Especially, we must all have the skills to write the program for AI. Therefore, our team should mostly concentrate on building ideas, organize our program, and buy some necessary equipment to start the project. There are some official software such as  Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine, Tensure Flow. This program is decorated for professional AI developers which I can build up the base from now as I could try to write some programs for the university to apply.
&ensp;
&ensp;
If the project could success, our team will be verify by the world as the number one for AI developing. Moreover, I could resolve the memory issue for those who have these serious illnesses for instance if your grandma doesn’t remember the way to get back home, then “R” will lead her the way back to the house, safe and secure. This AI will become the first one on Earth to know how to communicate fluently without any command line, else it can sense other emotions and reply to that, no one ever done this because it is hard and time-consuming.
