Interest in IT
<ul>
<li>
My brother is the one who inspired me to follow the IT patch. I said that because anytime I saw him on the computer, his fingers  surfed on the keyboard so fast that I couldn't even recognize what he was trying to type. Each line of code he types on the computer makes me wonder what he is going to create with those lines. Suddenly, he shows me that if any spam email or malware wants to enter our PC system, it will immediately remove the harmful material. From that moment, I feel that IT will be my future career where I could develop software that protects others' private information against those hackers who try to steal bank accounts, and customer data. Moreover, I have participated in a robotics coding competition 2 years ago which my team earned second place overall. This powerful experience I gained was really helpful with the major I currently study in Rmit. I have taken one more step closer to become a skillful software developer. Although I still need to put more effort into it, I will try my best.

</li>
&ensp;
<li>
I choose to study at Rmit because this university provides students with the most advanced technology for IT learning. In addition, many skillful, talented software engineers graduated from this University, and they all get hired by famous companies such as Google, Microsoft. Therefore, I want to become a member of Rmit where I could prove to everyone what my talent is, and maybe earn some computing reward. At Rmit, I can have the best study environment as well as the kind,helpful teachers. There is nothing to say much about the school facilities because everything is perfect. I like the way teachers in Rmit taught students, if you donâ€™t understand one part of the lecture, the teacher always please reply to your email about parts that you have trouble with.

</p>
<ul>
	<li>The position that I choose is IT engineering. The company required a leader for the IT engineering team, and the leader must support others in order for them to develop their skills. From my point of view, this position attracts me because I always want to become a leader of a team, or groups. Moreover, influencing other people, and helping them in work that they struggle with are my two strongest characteristics.
</li>
	<li>This position requires us to have experience in programming robots to transfer the semiconductors. Moreover, you must know how to code in C, and C++ coding language. Knowing the Japanese language is an advantage but not a requirement. In addition, you should have experience in this field, and graduate university. IOT and PLC need to be equipped in order to fit to this position.
</li>
	<li>Currently I study python and soon after this course I can learn more about other coding styles. I have watched lots of youtube people that teach coding, and I have tried to code some difficult commands. I have a nomination of winning a robot coding competition so I could use that as my experience in this field.
</li>
	<li>Right now, I will focus more on the lecture the teacher is giving to us in class, beside that I would look for a higher coding line on the internet to test myself. I have bought lots of books about robots, and developed a software to operate it successfully. I know lots about software so I'm definitely going to improve my current skills, and try to practice them every single day. One other method that I could try is I could ask my bigger brother, he is the master of this field, as I mentioned before. My brother always pleased to teach me the technique from basic up to complicated stuff, as far as I can still understand.With the help of family members, I think I should know more deeply about my major, and it is really useful when I apply my CV into the company for the leader position.</li>
